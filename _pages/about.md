After graduated from a dual bachelor's degree in History and Law, a master's degree in late modern history and a master's degree in *[Technologies numériques appliquées à l'histoire](https://www.chartes.psl.eu/fr/cursus/master-technologies-numeriques-appliquees-histoire)*, I did a year and a half at Inria as a research and development engineer, where I worked on the [DAHN project](https://github.com/FloChiff/DAHNProject), before becoming a PhD candidate.

I am a PhD candidate in digital humanities at [Le Mans Université](https://www.univ-lemans.fr/fr/index.html) and [ALMAnaCH's Inria](http://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html), under the supervision of [Anne Baillot](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/annebaillot) and [Laurent Romary](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/laurentromary). My work focuses on ground truth and transcription model and its title is *The Making of Text. Optical Script Recognition and Textual Heritage*. Any progress I make on my PhD can be found in a dedicated repository: [phd](https://github.com/FloChiff/phd).

When I don't work, I like to go to the movies, read all kind of books and see exhibitions.
